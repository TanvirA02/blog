== Usage examples and description ==

**Columns** - You can use this shortcode to split your content into columns and point out some important parts of your page content. They can be used in conjunction with any other shortcodes. You can write any content or insert any shortcode between column tags.

[mks_col]

[mks_one_half] Left content goes here [/mks_one_half]

[mks_one_half] Right content goes here [/mks_one_half]

[/mks_col]

**Separators** - These are simple horizontal line elements which you may use to divide some areas within your page content. Several styling options are provided.

[mks_separator style=″solid″ height=″2″]

**Buttons** - Basically, these are links with button style. You can target any URL here.

[mks_button size=″large″ title=″More about us″ style=″squared″ url=″http://mekshq.com″ target=″_self″ bg_color=″#000000″ txt_color=″#FFFFFF″ icon=″fa-road″]
			
**Dropcaps** - Mostly used to make big first letter of specific sentence.

[mks_dropcap style=″letter″ size=″52″ bg_color=″#ffffff″ txt_color=″#000000″]A[/mks_dropcap] smart theme SeaShell is.
			
**Highlights** - You can add colored background to some part of the text with this shortcode.

I can't wait to see how [mks_highlight color=″#dd3333″]awesome[/mks_highlight] SeaShell theme is.</pre>

**Pull Quotes** - Stylish boxes usually used to point out some important notes.

[mks_pullquote align=″left″ width=″300″ size=″24″ bg_color=″#000000″ txt_color=″#ffffff″]He who dares wins![/mks_pullquote]
			
**Icons** - Add some icons inside page/post content with this shortcode to make the content more interesting.

[mks_icon icon=″fa-star-o″ color=″#000000″] Five stars for this theme!

**Social Icons** - Add your social icons inside page/post content with this shortcode.

**Progress Bars** - Usually used to graphically display some of your skills or some analysis.

[mks_progressbar name=″WordPress″ level=″Pro″ value=″80″ height=″20″ color=″#000000″ style=″squared″]
			
**Tabs** - With this shortcode you can wrap some part of your content to be displayed as tabs.

**Toggles** - Use toggles shortcode if you want to display some content in show/hide manner.
